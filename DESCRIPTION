	   person("Gabriel", "Becker", email="gabembecker@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: This package provides a general framework and utility functions for
	     simulating or synthesizing database-like multiple-table datasets. This is
	     done by defining and then applying data recipes, which support the simulation
	     or derivation of multiple variables jointly and/or conditional on the value
	     of other already existing or recipe-specified variables. It also supports
	     the simulation or augmentation of data which encodes a 1-to-many relationship
	     with a foreign-key in an existing table.
