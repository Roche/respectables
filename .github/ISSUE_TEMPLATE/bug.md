<!--
Hi there,

Thank you for opening an issue.
-->

### Reproduction case

<!--
To fix problems, we need clear reproduction cases - we need to be able to see it happen locally. A reproduction case is ideally something that anyone can git-clone or copy-paste and run immediately, without inventing any details or context. 

A short example can be directly copy-pasteable; longer examples should be in separate a Github gist, or git repositories especially if multiple files are needed
-->


### sessionInfo() output

<!--
The output of sessionInfo(), so that we may emulate a similar environment to reproduce the issue.
-->

```R
# sessionInfo()
```

### Expected Behavior
<!--
What should have happened?

### Actual Behavior

### Additional Context

Are there anything atypical about your situation that we should know? For example, whether are you running this in a Docker container and the image that was used.
